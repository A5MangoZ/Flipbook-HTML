# PBL 0.1 : üìñ Flipbook
Welcome, Explorer, to my Repository. This repository is part of My Project Based Learning (PBL) initiative, specifically Mission Number 0.1. 

## üöÄ Mission Start

## üöÄ Mission End
> *The journey ends* on ***_______***

## üèÜ Objective
Create a simple digital flipbook using HTML and CSS. The flipbook will display a series of "pages" that users can navigate through by clicking on "Next" and "Previous" buttons. This project helps you practice working with layouts, transitions, and interactive elements.

## üéØ Key Objectives:
- **Cover Page:** A welcoming cover with a title and an introductory image or text.
- **Navigation Buttons:** "Next" and "Previous" buttons to navigate through the pages of the flipbook.
- **Page Content:** Each page will have different content, such as text, images, or a combination of both. The pages can include short stories, facts, or images with descriptions.
- **Page Transitions:** A smooth transition effect to simulate the flipping of pages.
- **Footer:** A footer with page numbers and possibly a copyright or author credit.

## üéÆ Mission Progress
#### HTML Structure:
- [ ] Use of `<div>` containers to represent each page.
- [ ] Basic elements like `<h1>, <h2>, <p>, <img>`, and <button> for content and navigation.

#### CSS Styling:
- [ ] Styling for the flipbook container and individual pages, including setting dimensions and positioning.
- [ ] Flexbox or Grid layout to align content within pages.
Styling buttons and adding hover effects.

#### Transitions and Animations:
- [ ] CSS transitions for smooth page flip effects, such as fading or sliding.
- [ ] Keyframes for more complex animations, if desired.

#### Basic Interactivity: 
- [ ] Using JavaScript to handle button clicks and navigate between pages (if you want to add a bit of JavaScript).
- [ ] Alternatively, CSS techniques like :target pseudo-class can be used for navigation without JavaScript.
